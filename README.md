# sycarion.github.io
Source of my Github Pages

To update the site currently, I need to generate the output in Publii and then use Github Desktop to sync. The sync settings are correct according to the Publii forum posts and documentation, but they do not work. I may have something wrong on the github side of things.
At least I can generate the site and it looks great. I love the Publii interface and plan to use it to convert my Wordpress sites to static HTML.
