title: "Vue.js: Building an Interface"
summary: "The perfect way to learn Vue.js is to use Vue.js. Once you build an app interface and see its strengths and flexibility in action, you can decide how much of Vue.js you want to use in your own projects. This hands-on course teaches you how to build a simple component-based app: an appointment booking and management system with features for searching and sorting."
