title: 'Vue.js: Working with APIs'
summary: 'Modern apps are shifting to a model where APIs provide the data and interactivity. Front-end developers decide how to present the information and interactions, and the APIs power the rest. Vue.js was built with these challenges in mind; itâ€™s a view-only framework specifically designed to integrate elegantly with other libraries.'
