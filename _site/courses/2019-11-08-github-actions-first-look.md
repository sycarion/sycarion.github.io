title: "Github Actions: First Look"
summary: Actions, a developer productivity and CI/CD suite of tools from GitHub, offers developers a new way to automate workflows for their web projects. Each action—which is a set of custom instructions—can be combined with other actions to create a workflow. You can have tasks that run on a specific timeframe, control what happens when someone interacts with the GitHub repository, and more.
