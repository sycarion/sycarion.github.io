title: "Three things I learned from six years as a teacher on Lynda.com"
summary: "It's my sixth year anniversary at lynda.com/LinkedIn Learning and milestones come with some reflection, so I wanted to share with you some of the things I've learned over the years. Although these are specific to my experience, I think you'll be able to relate to these and maybe share something you've learned from your own."
