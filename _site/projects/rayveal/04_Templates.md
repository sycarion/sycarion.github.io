# Templates

There are a number of templates that are quickly accessed by using data attributes in comments. Here are some of the templates currently available.

## Title Slide

`<!-- .slide: data-state="title" -->`

This is the title slide that appears at the beginning of the [demo](https://rayveal.tech). Blue background, large fonts.

## Page with Icons

`<!-- .slide: data-state="hasicon" -->`

A page that has a title with a Font Awesome icon in it. The spacing has to be different.

## Circles

`<!-- .slide: data-state="circles" -->`

In this page, each bullet point becomes a circle. Just a different way to help the user focus.
