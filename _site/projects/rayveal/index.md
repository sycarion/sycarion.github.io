# RayVeal.js

Rayveal is an opinionated version of the awesome [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). The main difference an approach to creating slides that is [markdown centered](https://github.github.com/gfm/) with the ability to create multiple presentations in the same project.

This, plus the pre-installation of convenient plugins and libraries make it easier to create your presentations quickly using markdown. That helps me focus on writing and not on laying out presentations.

You can see the demo at [rayveal.tech](http://rayveal.tech).
