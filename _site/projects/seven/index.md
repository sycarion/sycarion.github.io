# Seven

This project is a template for building sites using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) static site generator. You can see a demo of the site at [7ty.tech](https://7ty.tech). It features a Vue.js powered simple search based on what's in `_site/posts` and `_site/courses` as well as pagination, animations and more.

## Quickstart

- `Clone` or `download` the repo
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the development server.
- Point your browser to `localhost:8080`
- Edit posts in the `_site/posts` or `_site/courses` folder.
- Run `npm run build` to build the project.
