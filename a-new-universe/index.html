One of the major characters was Jeremiah Matherson, a local hero that ran the local store in the 40s and 50s. Rationing was difficult in my hometown and in these stories, Matherson used his mistrust of authority to help everyone. <a href="http://prairiecomber.pinakidion.org/fistful-of-diamonds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Fistful of Diamonds</a> is my favorite story that has him as a character.</p><p>The main character that tied all the stories together, though, was Numbers the cat. With an impossibly long lifespan, Numbers was known and loved by generations of people that frequented Matherson's store. He would disappear occasionally, sometimes for months at a time. By the time the events of Fistful of Diamonds takes place, he is believed to be between 25 and 40 years old. Shortly after this story, a second cat appears when Numbers is gone for long stretches. Named Deuteronomy, this cat makes appearances until the late 90s. A third cat appears in the 80s, but Joshua proves to be much more ordinary than her ancestors. She barely lives twelve years.</p><p>The secret of Numbers the cat was his time travel. He found a small entrance just big enough to squeeze through to take him to random places in time both past and future. In a couple of stories, he is playing with untimely toys from the distant past and near future.</p><p>For the purposes of my stories, this will be universe 4 Numbers I. The Compendium has only encountered this accidental tourist in time one time. It was entirely accidental when a Compendium employee was briefly stranded near Matherson's store circa 1955. The chronoton particle readings were very high which merited some study.</p><p>Numbers regarded his stay at the Compendium as the place with horrible food and little amusement. He disappeared one day and no one has discovered how he left. They were able to verify that he returned home to Matherson's store, but no one ever determined what magic or device allowed him to return.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 21, 2023</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/tags/4-numbers-i/">4 Numbers I</a></li><li><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/tags/paper-pills/">paper pills</a></li><li><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/tags/worldbuilding/">worldbuilding</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div></footer></article><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2022-08-31T05:57" class="date">August 31, 2022</time><h2><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/directory-of-universes/">Directory of Universes</a></h2></header><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/directory-of-universes/" class="image fit"><img src="https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024.jpg" srcset="https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024-xs.jpg 300w, https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024-sm.jpg 480w, https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024-md.jpg 768w, https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024-lg.jpg 1024w, https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="1024" width="687" alt="An old drawing of the sun, planets, and other worlds of the universe"></a><p>There are a few universes that I want to list here and describe in more detail as well as provide more examples of&hellip;</p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/directory-of-universes/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article></div></main><footer id="copyright"><p class="align-center">Theme by Â© Massively ~ Design: HTML5 UP ~ Powered by Publii</p></footer></div><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
