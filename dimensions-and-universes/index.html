Information about all the various universes are stored in a Compendium. To classify the universes, the convention is:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Number of Dimensions + Name of First Contact or Distinct Feature + Number of Times the contact or feature has been encountered. For example, 10 Compendium I, would be the tenth dimension with the first encounter of the distinctive feature of a Compendium. For those that play D&amp;D, the Forgotten Realms could be named 3 Elminster IV, a third dimensional place where the first contact with the Compendium was a mage named Elminster. The number can be anything you like, I chose four to hint that there are at least three other alternate versions of Elminster from worlds different in some way from the Forgotten Realms.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I will say up front that it is based on string theory, but is not accurate to it at all. I took a lot of creative license to make up the psuedoscience that describes how the continuum works.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Dimensions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Continuum exists in <a href="http://www.questseans.com/space-cadet/2018/7/10/10-dimensions-of-reality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ten dimensions</a>. Our present reality exists in the third dimension as well as the vast majority of known universes. They are the most accessible by 21st century technology and mental capacity to understand those universes.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Black Holes are super dense tears in the strings of the universe. Particles from the dimensions four through six survive in a given universe while those from higher dimensions degrade as soon as they appear. Below are the known particles that allow for travel in dimensions four through six:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Chronoton: Time particle. A field of these particles is used to measure relative time in a given universe.</li><li>Pithanoton: Probability particle. A field of these particles can be used to measure relative probability of parallel universes. It is a GPS of parallel universal travel that enables you to arrive safely back at your own universe and know that it is yours with 100% certainty.</li><li>Hexaton Fields: combination of Pithanoton and Chronoton particles that allow travel to parallel worlds at any point in time within those worlds.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Higher dimensional worlds, dimensions seven through nine are those that did not begin with the Big Bang. Travel to these dimensions (and their component universes) is available only through the use of magic on the Conduit.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Compendium</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The tenth dimension houses the various Compendiums. As the tenth dimension allows access to all lower dimensions, intelligent species have created repositories of knowledge throughout this dimension. When you exist in the place of all possibilities, storage isn't a problem. As one Compendium encounters another, they often merge. The author of the Sycarion Continuum works in Compendium I as middle management over a team of researchers.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Conduit</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Ylem is defined as the substance of the universe before the Big Bang. Some believe it is composed entirely of neutrons and anti-neutrons held together by gravity and photons. (This is multiiversally dismissed.) Most consider ylem as an idea that allows for a convenient way to talk about the continuum before its existence. If it is a real substance, the ability to manipulate Ylem would allow for creation and destruction of multiverses.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Prevailing theories state that the multiverse began with a primordial force expanding ylem in directions that correspond to the ten dimensions. Expansion in dimensions one through four happened immediately, with expansion into the fifth and sixth dimensions occurring moments afterwards. Expansion into the higher dimensions occurred in the past, present, and future of the beginning of the multiverse and the primordial force expanded ylem through time in all directions. Many of the multiverses were born through a process similar to the Big Bang. Others, though, began in a Solid State, while others began in other ways.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The first sentient beings began in the higher dimensions. They were able to travel throughout the higher dimensions to millions of indescribable worlds, but encountered barriers when traveling to multiverses that began differently from their own. Those in worlds that began with a Big Bang could only travel to worlds that were created in the same way. Despite awareness of the existence of other worlds, travel to those worlds was impossible.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It is not known who discovered The Conduit, but it exists as a way to travel between worlds with different origins. In other words, to travel through dimensions seven through 10. In any given universe, The Conduit appears as an opening similar to a cave entrance. The size will change to accommodate the size of any object (including planets) traveling through it. The Conduit is located beneath the Surface of Mars in our universe, allowing creatures from any world in the ten dimensions to travel here and vice versa. As many traveled to and from our universe, conflict began. At the end of the conflict, The Conduit in our universe was closed. Those travelers trapped in our universe visiting sentient creatures throughout our universe. Some were benevolent, but many sought to exploit this universe's resources to gain power.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Dimensional Paradox</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Dimensions five through ten exist on a subatomic level. We do not perceive them because of their size. However, when traveling to alternate dimensions, once you arrive at one, your home universe becomes subatomic to your perception. Although this seems to be merely a change in perception, study of pithanoton particles confirm this fact.</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 13, 2023</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/tags/compendium/">compendium</a></li><li><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/tags/nomenclature/">nomenclature</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div></footer></article><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2022-08-31T05:57" class="date">August 31, 2022</time><h2><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/directory-of-universes/">Directory of Universes</a></h2></header><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/directory-of-universes/" class="image fit"><img src="https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024.jpg" srcset="https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024-xs.jpg 300w, https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024-sm.jpg 480w, https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024-md.jpg 768w, https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024-lg.jpg 1024w, https://sycarion.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/a-synopsis-of-the-universe-or-the-visible-world-epitomizd-1-1024-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="1024" width="687" alt="An old drawing of the sun, planets, and other worlds of the universe"></a><p>There are a few universes that I want to list here and describe in more detail as well as provide more examples of&hellip;</p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/directory-of-universes/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article></div></main><footer id="copyright"><p class="align-center">Theme by © Massively ~ Design: HTML5 UP ~ Powered by Publii</p></footer></div><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
