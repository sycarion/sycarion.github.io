The post itself is about a fictional ancestor to Yahtzee from 3rd century Rome. The world building touches on ancient Roman-Chinese trade, the rise of Esperanto, and historical records.</em> Cúarapom is pronounced (<strong>Quar</strong>-a-pom, not the way I keep saying it, <strong>Quare</strong>-uh-pom)</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">History of Cúarapom and It's Language, Arcaicam Esperantom.</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Flavio Biondo</h3>\n<p>Scholars had long believed that Flavio Biondo, 15th century historian, had a lost work that detailed Roman history from the time of the Etruscans to 410 AD as a prequel to his famous history, <em>Historiarum ab inclinatione Romanorum imperii decades</em>. Notes from his posthumous publisher hinted at note of pre-Roman times, but nothing conclusive.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Churchill Babington's Personal Effects</h3>\n<p>In 1865, Churchill Babington published <em>An Introductory Lecture on Archaeology</em> that points to a paper written in his early career about the Preists of Nortia. In this paper, he mentioned the famous fertility rite, but also attributes the Goddess of Fate with a relic of a dodecahedron discovery in the 1830s near the Palatine Hills. Quoting an unknown work of Biondo, he describes the twelve-sided object as a divination device for Nortian priests.</p>\n<p>Amongst his effects after Babington's death was a manuscript of Biondo's lost work that detailed Etruscan and Roman history. This work features many pieces of works thought to be lost to antiquity, including a passage written by Livy that details the dodecahedron, its symbols, and the possible meaning of the results. Livy also mentioned that there were, in fact, four dodecahedrons, each with their own symbols. Babington appeared to have no small fascination with these objects producing a reconstruction based on citations from Livy.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connections to Arcaicam Esperantom</h3>\n<p>Another discovery near Shenyang in the 1870s produced missing pieces of <em>Wei lio</em>, a 3rd century document that describes relations between Rome and China written by Yu Huan. Babington had a translated copy, but many discredit this translation as wildly inaccurate and prone historical errors. (The original document has been authenticated and current English translations have corrected these issues.)</p>\n<p>The new manuscript describes the relationship of Lieou Tche-ki to a Roman he names Feng-Ti, \"Crazy Western Barbarian\". As a part of their business relationship, Feng-Ti attempts to invent a trading language to assist his men in understanding the cargo they are transporting. It even includes some of the vocabulary and grammar that clearly demonstrates Latin and Chinese root words modified by affixes.</p>\n<p>It appears that Lieou Tche-ki rejected this idea, but entertained it enough to humor his trading partner. Over the course of his musings, he mentions a pastime of the sailors that he writes as Cuarapom, using the trading language.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Arcaicam Esperantom</h3>\n<p>After L.L. Zamenhof published Unua Libro 1887, devotees called for numerous changes to Esperanto. Zamenhoff continued to refine Esperanto by translating other works, especially poetry. This changed when he heard of the new additions to Wei lio and their publication in English. Friends had mentioned the passage describing Feng Ti's trading language and acquired a copy to study.</p>\n<p>His goal was to recreate a language that he saw as an ancestor to Esperanto. With this ancestor language, he would then attempt to evolve it in much the same way that Romance languages evolved from Latin. This would address a frequent criticism that Esperanto had no history and felt contrived.</p>\n<p>In 1893, he produced a manuscript for Arcaicam Esperantom, but never published it. It is believed that the attempt to create this ancestor languge was the main cause in the rejection of 1894 update to Esperanto. His 1904 changes removed many of the inventions seen in his 1894 draft.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cúarapom's Survival</h3>\n<p>A curious exception to the rejection of Zamenhof's 1894 version of Esperanto, was the inclusion of a game he named Kvarapo, a curious game of Four-of-a-Kind. He also mentions the game by a different name, Cúarapom, apparently pointing to the so-called ancestor of Esperanto. The odd dodecahedrons described in the game were produced and the game was briefly popular in Europe.</p>\n<p>This popularity led to uncovering the Arcaicam Esperatom manuscript featuring the full set of rules written in that language. Zamenhoff's notes made it clear that he kept all of the words of the original game described in Wei lio, but added the names of certain results and filled in missing pieces in the game itself that he discovered through playing it.</p>\n<p>When the game was published in 1901, it was published in English and Arcaicam Esperatom along with a modified version of the history calling it \"The Game of Roman Sailors\". The game became popular and was enjoyed on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>With the advent of World War I, the game lost popularity due to the issues in manufacturing the dice. After World War II a similar game named Yacht grew in popularity and in 1956 a version of it named Yahtzee was published by Milton Bradley.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cúarapom's Revival</h3>\n<p>In recent years, I've become interested in Cúarapom. I hope to make the dice, but I get by with a d6 numbered 1 to 3, a d4, a d6, and a d12. If you want to make the dice, I created 3d models for them in my <a href=\"https://github.com/sycarion/stldice/tree/master/d12s/cuarapom\" title=\"Cuarapom Dice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stldice repository</a>. In the meantime, I have created <a href=\"https://sycarion.github.io/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JpwN0TyhlbKBZsBv1k1X7xtPLx8sXE0W/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" download>score sheets</a> and cleaned up an older version of the <a href=\"https://sycarion.github.io/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f5ZmQZc6T9eawQFdOUq-kBWRGNYDmIR_/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" download>English rules</a>. (There will be edits.)</p>\n<p>I kept a few of the original names of results, but it felt like too much mental overhead to use them all. That's why Three of a Kind is in English instead of the original term, Triapom. Sinsecúom for a straight felt like a big stretch when there are already other vocabulary words. I hope I found the right balance.</p>\n<p>In playing the game, I've found that it is difficult to score in the lower section. Most games are won by the strategic use of the upper section and the two categories that are similar to Chance in Yahtzee. It is extremely difficult to score the Pluy Gravam and attempts to roll it, even with a 4th Roll token have proven unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think.</p>",

Many gamers know of the Forgotten Realms, so this is merely an illustration. If requested, I will take down this post and rework this example with Abraham Lincoln. It's just that I like D&amp;D and this was the first thing that came to mind. Elminster's unique and detailed history lends itself to a full description of the naming system.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Forgotten Realms as an Example</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>3 Elminster</strong> <strong>IV</strong> - This universe is the Forgotten Realms in 1357 DR. This is the Forgotten Realms at the end of its 1st edition run before the gods were forced to the mortal world. The year is determined by when, in his world, Elminster was discovered by the Compendium. Using pithanoton particles, this was the fourth version of Elminster encountered. The time of the discovery of Elminster is set as a reference point to talk about dimensions four and five more easily.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Referencing events in the past or future of the Forgotten Realms would be <strong>4 Elminster</strong> <strong>IV</strong>. The change from 3 to 4 represents a change in time. Time is relative, so there is no set time. Researchers may add a detail like 4 Elminster IV in DR 1385 (This would represent the beginning of the Spellplague.) or 4 Elminster IV in -2207 DR to represent a time during the golden age of Netheril. Both are 4 Elminster IV because it is a different point in time than 1357 DR.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Referencing alternate events of that world would be <strong>5 Elminster</strong> <strong>IV</strong>. This would include a universe where the Blue Age lasted longer because Dendar didn't eat the sun or the events of the Spellplague never happened. For clarity, all fifth dimensional universe names include references to a year and at least one point of divergence from its third dimensional parent. Fifth dimensional universes are uniquely identified by their pithanoton signature. More on those below.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} --></p>\n<h4>Pithanoton Particles</h4>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Everything has a pithanoton signature that helps Compendium researchers determine the dimensional origin of a specific person, place, or thing. It is also used to distinguish between two or more identical objects and to determine possible relationships between two or more objects. Specifically, this would help determine the difference between Elminster I and Elminster IV. Elminster I belongs to a universe that was created in a slightly different way than Elminster IV. In the <em>Sycarion Continuum</em>, Elminster I's world was created similar to our world, the creation mythology is different, and magic doesn't exist. The Compendium encountered this Elminster as a mathematician and theoretical physicist working in a particle accelerator facility. References to this world would be <strong>3 Elminster I</strong> (which is around 2017 CE), <strong>4 Elminster I</strong> (any time outside of 2017CE), or <strong>5 Elminster I</strong> (an alternate reality where Elminster becomes an English teacher).</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Remember that this system is about identifying <em>universes</em>, not <em>individuals</em>. As such, there is a <strong>3 Dendar I </strong>where Elminster exists, but he is not the Elminster of any other universe. He has a unique pithanoton signature. The universe is named Dendar because he was the first object from that dimension encountered. Researchers do not trace every individual throughout the multiverse, even the most interesting ones.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>There can be mistakes like the false discovery of <strong>3 Elmara I</strong>. Elmara was encountered by the researcher, but the pithanoton signature quickly determined that Elminster and Elmara were the same person and that she was in an already discovered universe. Since this was around 232 DR, <strong>3 Elmara I</strong> was reclassified as <strong>4 Elminster IV</strong>, since it was a different relative time of <strong>3 Elminster IV</strong>.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I don't plan to post anything about Forgotten Realms, it's not my world. I hope this serves as a helpful reference that is a bit more fun that using a former president.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>Universes that I Will Write About</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>3 陸 運使 XIV </strong>- Over 120 iterations of Lu Yùn Shĭ have made contact with the Compendium.

Universes in the first dimension are either occupied by a singular being or an inert non-living point of matter. Some tourists visit dimensions like Solitude to find the ultimate sensory deprivation chamber only to discover a cacophony of noise and energy from other tourists.

There are an infinite number of 1 Omnis dimensions, but they differ only in the sequence of thoughts of their repetitive sole entities. The Compendium considers this odd effect of perceiving a point as a line to be the origin of the phrase \"line of thinking\".</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Employing protective energy or magic has created a cottage industry for tourists to listen to the thoughts of a creature that has no known capacity to conceive of anything outside of itself.

It is the force that holds all measurement, time, and possibilities together. The most common names are The Singularity, The Breath, Magic, The Universal Equation, or the OmniForce. In my worlds, the Fundamental Force is called <strong>Magic</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Fundamental Particle is known only in some of the multiverses where sentient species actively interact with the Fundamental Force. Like the Fundamental Force, it has an infinite number of names. In this game, the Fundamental Particle is called an <strong>Ousia</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Dimensions</h2>\n<p>The first four dimensions are familiar to many: length, width, depth, and time. All creatures move about in space-time within their respective universes. In other words, creatures travel from one place to another and experience time as a series of moments that make up the past and the present moment. The future represents moments that have yet to occur. For a game that never ventures to other galaxies and stays largely centered on Earth, this will be all that any character needs to know.</p>\n<p>For time travel within a universe, <strong>Chronotons</strong> or <em>Time Particles</em> are used to generate a field that measures relative time. Once time is mapped, time travel is possible.</p>\n<h3>Parallel Universes</h3>\n<p>Dimensions five and six deal with probability and all possible outcomes of events that happen in any given moment. <span class=\"md-plain\"><strong>Pithanotons</strong> or <em>Probability Particles</em> are used to generate a field that measures relative probabilities of parallel universes. In other words, It is a GPS of parallel universal travel that enables you to safely travel back and forth in parallel universes. </span><span class=\"md-plain\"><strong>Hexaton Fields</strong> are a combination of Pithanoton and Chronoton particles that allow travel to parallel worlds <em>at any point in time</em> in those worlds. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"md-plain\">For universes that develop travel to parallel universes, Hexaton Fields allow travellers to arrive back in their homeworld at the exact moment after they left.</span></p>\n<h3>Strange Universes</h3>\n<p>Dimensions seven, eight, and nine are comprised of completely alien universes where the laws of physics operate differently. These universes include the realms of the Gods, anti-matter universes, and madness-inducing horrors.</p>\n<p>Travel to these worlds requires the use of the Fundamental Force or the Fundamental Particle. <strong>Magic</strong> is typical for universes that are not scientifically developed, <strong>Ousia</strong> is used in worlds that have an advanced understanding of science and magic. It is not possible to understand Ousia without an understanding of Magic.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Omniverse is comprised of all possible universes within all ten dimensions.</li>\n<li>Magic is not unexplained science, it is a fundamental force that exists everywhere in the Omniverse.</li>\n<li>With the right science, it is possible to travel in space, time, and parallel universes.</li>\n<li>With magic, it is possible to travel in space, time, parallel universes, <em>and strange universes.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",
