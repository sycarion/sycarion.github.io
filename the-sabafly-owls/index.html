They discovered, however, that the concepts of Heaven and Hell were not the same as those universes. Hell was a land of the dead. It's where souls went in an endless land where residents lose their memory of life in the mortal world.  There is no fire, brimstone, or endless torture there. Many researchers say that Hell would be better named Ennui for all the listlessness and perceived boredom.</p><p>Heaven, as it turned out, was a different plane created by those with religious inclinations. A soul, by force of will, could end up in this plane instead of Hell if they believed strongly enough in a place of reward for the truly devout. For the Romans of the various Sanderson universes, Heaven would exactly like the Elysium fields. For those that believe in the pantheon that includes the Sabafly Owls, the Cathatadines, and Ptoma, Heaven is a place of endless virtue. (The eight virtues are love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and restraint). Heaven is also a place where those that are not religious enough are zealously converted.</p><p>Catharates is a celestial being that originally came to guide the powers of Hell to make changes. Hell changed from a hunting grounds for religious zealots to the land of dead described earlier. Ptoma, one of the original Sabafly Owls, rebelled against these changes forcing Catharates to permanently alter him. The unintended consequences, though, led to the creation of the cult of abdeath.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 13, 2023</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/tags/hadarianapfragment/">#HadarianAPFragment</a></li><li><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/tags/6-catharates-i/">6 Catharates I</a></li><li><a href="https://sycarion.github.io/tags/worldbuilding/">worldbuilding</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><p class="align-center">Theme by © Massively ~ Design: HTML5 UP ~ Powered by Publii</p></footer></div><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://sycarion.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
